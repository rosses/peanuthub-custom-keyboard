Unobstrive AngularJs/Ionic Component for Ionic 1

**Note:** *Custom Keyboard is under active development. As such, while this library is well-tested, the API may change. Consider using it in production applications only if you're comfortable following a changelog and updating your usage accordingly.*


# Get Started

**(1)** Get Custom Keyboard in one of the following ways:
 - [download the release](https://bitbucket.org/peanuthub/peanuthub-custom-keyboard)
 - or via **[Bower](http://bower.io/)**: by running `$ bower install peanuthub-custom-keyboard --save` from your console

**(2)** Include `peanuthub-custom-keyboard.js` (or `peanuthub-custom-keyboard.min.js`) in your `index.html`

**(3)** Include `peanuthub-custom-keyboard.css` (or `peanuthub-custom-keyboard.min.css`) in your `index.html`

**(4)** Add `peanuthub-custom-keyboard` to your main module's list of dependencies

When you're done, your setup should look similar to the following:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html ng-app="myApp">
<head>
	<!-- IONIC STUFF -->

        angular.module('myApp', ['peanuthub-custom-keyboard'])
        
        
        //Add Custom Keyboard 
        .config(function($peanuthubCustomKeyboardProvider) {
          $peanuthubCustomKeyboardProvider.addCustomKeyboard('CUSTOM_SKU', {

# Report an Issue

Help us make Peanut Hub Components better! If you think you might have found a bug, or some other weirdness, start by making sure
it hasn't already been reported. You can [search through existing issues](https://bitbucket.org/peanuthub/peanuthub-custom-keyboard/issues)
to see if someone's reported one similar to yours.

If not, then [create a plunkr](http://bit.ly/UIR-Plunk) that demonstrates the problem (try to use as little code
as possible: the more minimalist, the faster we can debug it).

Next, [create a new issue](https://bitbucket.org/peanuthub/peanuthub-custom-keyboard/issues) that briefly explains the problem,
and provides a bit of background as to the circumstances that triggered it. Don't forget to include the link to
that plunkr you created!

**(4)** Finally, commit some code and open a pull request. Code & commits should abide by the following rules:

*Always*
- Commits should represent one logical change each; if a feature goes through multiple iterations, squash your commits down to one
